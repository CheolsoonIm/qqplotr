## R CMD check results

There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs.

The following NOTE was received when building the package:

```
  Maintainer: 'Adam Loy <loyad01@gmail.com>'
  
  New maintainer:
    Adam Loy <loyad01@gmail.com>
  Old maintainer(s):
    Alexandre Almeida <almeida.xan@gmail.com>
```

We are transferring maintainership to me (Adam) since Alex is starting a new career path and won't be focused on R development/maintainence.
